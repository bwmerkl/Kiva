#Cover Letter

*9 September 2021*

Dear Blaine Gorman and Kiva team,

I’m applying for the Senior Manager, Content & Community position at Kiva. As a [decade-long Kiva lender](https://www.kiva.org/lender/bwmerkl), I'm delighted to get the chance to further Kiva's impact with my skills in content marketing and SEO.

As a professional, I’ve completed the content marketing hat trick: freelance, agency and in-house, including both sides of the B2C/B2B coin. As with width, so with depth: I’ve worked at every level of the editorial stack, from copywriting, editing, SEO and publishing, to managing vendors, hiring staff, project management and long-term content strategy. Much of my marketing experience in open source tech has been community-oriented, and I've served on cross-functional teams for large events and regional user conferences. Along the way, I’ve used much of the marketer’s toolbox: HubSpot, Marketo, Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft Office, WordPress, Trello, etc. 

Something you won't find on my resume is that I've spent the last five years working remotely from Southeast Asia. With a spouse in non-profit education, I've witnessed the impact of international development done well — and done poorly. In particular, I've seen how "poverty porn" storytelling not only misleads donors but also damages the communities it aims to improve. In Thailand, Bangladesh and Myanmar, we lived and worked in communities Kiva borrowers call home. I would bring those lessons and experiences to this position.

Also during our time in Asia, I had the opportunity to volunteer as a regular writing instructor at Minmahaw School in Thailand and the Asian University for Women (AUW) in Bangladesh. In both positions, I had to work across cultural and linguistic barriers in order to have an effective impact on the lives of students.

Bottom line: I'm a long-time believer and supporter of Kiva's mission; I'm a creative storyteller with strategy and SEO savvy; and I'm experienced in the woes and whoas of cross-cultural communication and development. I believe all these threads cinch together to perfectly fit the position you're trying to fill. 

Let me know if you’d like to talk further,
